# Nutrition Basics

* There are 45 essential nutrients that we *must* get from food,
  * Some of these consist of proteins, fats, carbohydrates, vitamins, minerals, and water.
* The two types of nutrients are *macronutrients* (important nutrients required in relatively large amounts) and *micronutrients*(important nutrients required in minute amounts):

| Macronutrients | Micronutrients |
| :------------: | :------------: |
|    Protein     |    Vitamins    |
|      Fat       |    Minerals    |
|  Carbohydrate  |                |
|     Water      |                |

> Nutrients are available to the body through *digestion* -- the process of breaking down foods into compounds the body can use.

* Nutrients are important because they provide energy to support and regulate body functions.

## Energy

* *Kilocalories (kcals)* is the unit of measurement of energy in food.
* A person needs about `2,000 kcals` per day.

> The 3 sources of energy are *fats, proteins, and carbohydrates*.

| Source of Energy | Calories per gram |
| :--------------: | :---------------: |
|       Fat        |         9         |
|     Protein      |         4         |
|  Carbohydrates   |         4         |

* The ***nutrient density*** is the ratio of a food's essential nutrients to its calories.

## The Digestive System

1. Food is *partially* broken down by being chewed and mixed with saliva in the mouth.
2. Food travels to the stomach via the esophagus and is broken down further by stomach acids and other secretions.
3. As food travels through the digestive tract, it is mixed by muscular contractions to facilitate further digestion and absorption. Absorption of nutrients occurs via the lining of the small intestine. The large intestine reabsorbs excess water.
4. Any remaining solid wastes are collected in the rectum and excreted through the anus.

### Proteins

> Proteins form parts of muscle, bone, blood, enzymes, hormones, and cell membranes.

Proteins are composed of amino acids:

* There are 20 common amino acids,
  * 9 are essential
  * 11 are nonessential (since the body can produce them)

***Complete*** proteins provide all essential amino acids:

* Most *animal* proteins are complete proteins,
* Most *plant* proteins are incomplete proteins (legumes, nuts)

> The recommended protein intake is `0.8` grams per kilogram of body weight.

The amount of daily protein, fat, and carbohydrate intake varies between genders (male, female) -- men consume more of each (in grams) than women.

### Fats

> Fats (lipids) are the most concentrated source of energy.

Fats:

* Store energy
* Provide insulation and support
* 9 calories of energy per gram

***Triglycerides*** are fats in foods, and there are many types:

* Saturated,
* Unsaturated,
* Monounsaturated,
* Polyunsaturated

> *Trans fats* are associated with *increased* low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL), which is known as the "bad" cholesterol, and *decreased* high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL), the "good" cholesterol.

### Carbohydrates

> Carbohydates supply energy for body cells. The recommended carb intake amount is `130` grams. Consuming a diet rich in complex carbohydrates is ideal (especially whole grains).

There are two types of carbohydates -- *simple* and *complex*.

* During digestion, carbohydrates are broken down into *glucose* for absorption.

*Glycemic index* is a measure of how a particular food affects blood glucose levels.

* Insulin and glucose levels rise and fall,
  * A quick rise in both levels produces a *high* glycemic index.

Consuming foods that contain a high glycemic index may:

* Increase appetite
* Increase risk of diabetes and heart disease

> *Added sugars* refers to white sugar, brown sugar, high-fructose corn syrup, and other sweeteners added to most processed foods.

A high intake of added sugars is linked to dental cavities, excess weight, and type 2 diabetes.

*Sugars should come mainly from whole fruits and low-fat milk and other dairy products!*
