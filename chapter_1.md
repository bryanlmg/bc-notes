# A "Sound" Science

> Explains the importance of phonetics and the IPA, provides reasons for a variation in phonetic transcription practice, and states the benefits of using a Unicode font for phonetic transcription.

Speech organs consist of:

* Teeth,
* Lips,
* Tongue

***Phonetics*** is the study of how speech sounds are produced by the speech organs and perceived -- and how individual speech sounds are created and combined during the speech process to form syllables and words.

> The **IPA** (*<u>I</u>nternational <u>P</u>honetic <u>A</u>lphabet*) is designed to <u>represent the *sounds* of words</u>, not their spellings. It enables us to transcribe speech sounds.

### Phonetics vs. Phonology

|                          Phonetics                           |                          Phonology                           |

| Focuses on the study of speech sounds, their acoustic and perceptual characteristics, and how they're produced by the speech organs. | Focuses on the linguistic (phonological) rules that are used to specify the manner in which speech sounds are organized and combined into meaningful units, which are then combined to form syllables, words, and sentences. |
